I have some projects using Ruby On Rails, and must confess that I love working on it, specifically a project that I developed with some colleagues called Pet Your Life.

**And the most important news is that I'm studying Software Engineering!!!**

I'm a creative person, who loves technology, and who is always studying to improve my knowledge.
